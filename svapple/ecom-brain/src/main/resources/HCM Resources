Human capital management (HCM) is differentiated from human resource management (HRM) by one word.
  For many HR professionals, it is also distinguished by an important difference in perspective.
   While HRM has traditionally looked at the people in an organization as a resource to be acquired,
    allocated and replaced as necessary (much like any other resource), an HCM  approach… ” Perceives people as assets (human capital) whose current value can be measured and whose future value can be enhanced through investment.”

I think we need to understand its not super set or sub set game.its aactualy perspective or startegy to mnanage Human capital
